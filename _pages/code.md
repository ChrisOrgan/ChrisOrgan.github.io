# Code

We host our code on GitHub [here](https://github.com/ChrisOrgan) (main), [here](https://github.com/JDGardner94) (Jacob Gardner), and [here](https://github.com/suryakevin) (Kevin Surya). Code under active develop are in private repos, but please drop us an <a href="mailto:organ@montana.edu">email</a> if you are interested in testing or collaborating. Chris currently spends most of his develop time on PyPhy -- a phylogenetic data science library.

### PyPhy & Comparative Methods

PyPhy is a general purpose library for the statistical analysis, modelling, and machine learning of evolved data using phylogenetic trees (phylogenetic comparative methods). Functions include phylogenetic EDA, plotting, and modelling of continuous and categorical data in reference to evolutionary (phylogenetic) trees. Most of the solutions are Bayesian (Hamiltonian Markov chain Monte Carlo) and account for varying levels of uncertainty across the data and a tree or posterior distribution of trees. PyPhy is being developed in collaboration with [Andrew Meade](http://www.reading.ac.uk/biologicalsciences/about/staff/a-meade.aspx) at the University of Reading, UK.

*The PyPhy logo to the left demonstrates a Bayesian MCMC sampler using [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/) and [imcmc](https://github.com/ColCarroll/imcmc) (5 chains -- each chain is a different color, 8000 iterations).*
