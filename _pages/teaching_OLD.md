### Honors Evolution

This class focuses on evolution across scales and systems, from the evolution of populations of organisms to the emergence of new languages. Understanding how evolution proceeds at the molecular level is increasingly important across many fields within biology alone, from microbiology and ecology to cancer biology. Moreover, the knowledge and skills required to obtain, parse, and analyze data sets, is now an essential skill in many industries and academic research. At a broader scale of evolution, we will explore phylogenetics (inference of evolutionary trees) and comparative methods (statically analyzing how traits evolve along evolutionary trees). Here we will explore data, concepts, and theories from diverse disciplines, including ecology, paleontology, genomics, medicine, and culture. The principle of consilience will be discussed as a central approach to studying evolution.

Lectures will emphasize knowledge, concepts, and computational details of various algorithms and methods of hypothesis testing.

### Earth History & Evolution

This class covers the evolution of the earth and its life from origin to present configuration, including the role of plate tectonics and major evolutionary patterns in the history of life. At the end of this course, I want students to be able to:
1. Describe the major groups of life, their traits and evolutionary trends
2. Summarize the major geological patterns and processes that shaped the planet
3. Articulate how hypotheses are formed and tested in historical sciences
4. Demarcate science from pseudoscience, and appreciate how evidence and reason drive scientific inquiry

### DINOSAURS!

This class covers the origin, biology, evolution, and extinction of dinosaurs. Topics of special emphasis include the origin of birds, macroevolutionary patterns and processes, and major adaptations. At the end of this course, I want students to be able to:

1. Summarize dinosaur biology (origins, biogeography, life history, and extinction)
2. Articulate current debates in evolutionary biology and dinosaur paleontology
3. Describe Mesozoic ecosystems and environments
4. Evaluate the role that fossils and dinosaurs play in understanding biologic evolution and the diversity of life
5. Demarcate science from pseudoscience, and appreciate how evidence and reason drive scientific inquiry
