# Teaching & Mentoring

Throughout my career, I have enjoyed diverse cultures, from the Land-grant mission of Montana State University, to the University of Reading’s international community and Harvard’s Ivy League. I have also benefited from a variety of mentors, including minorities and women. Here is what I have found: clear expectations, training plans, and quality assurance guidelines help all students thrive, and are essential for fostering equity and inclusion. A 2005 Sigma Xi survey found that US postdocs whose professional development was organized and managed were more satisfied and productive (~25%) than those with little oversight. All students should be actively managed and mentored, not just postdocs. Our laboratory benefits from:
