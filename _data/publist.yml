  description: We show that PCM parameter estimation is poor in common biological scenarios due to small effective (evolutionary) sample sizes of independent character change. We suggest that researchers 1) Create study designs that evaluate a priori hypotheses and maximize evolutionary sample sizes; 2) assess the suitability of evolutionary models and introduce the phylogenetic imbalance ratio; and 3) evaluate evolutionary hypotheses with a consilience of evidence from disparate fields.

  image: Tuatara.png
  description: The tuatara (*Sphenodon punctatus*) — the only living member of the reptilian order Rhynchocephalia (Sphenodontia), once widespread across Gondwana — is an iconic species that is endemic to New Zealand. A key link to the now-extinct stem reptiles (from which dinosaurs, modern reptiles, birds and mammals evolved), the tuatara provides key insights into the ancestral amniotes...

  description: Genome size has long been hypothesized to affect the metabolic rate in various groups of animals. The mechanism behind this proposed association is the nucleotypic effect, in which large nucleus and cell sizes influence cellular metabolism through surface area-to-volume ratios...

  description: Here, we develop a sampling bias proxy that incorporates geographic information and test it with a case study on early tetrapodomorph biogeography. We use recently-developed Bayesian phylogeographic models and a new supertree of early tetrapodomorphs to estimate dispersal rates and ancestral habitat locations...
